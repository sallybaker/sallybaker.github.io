Notes from a two-day workshop using Jupyter notebooks for digital humanities research. 

<!--more-->
The workshop provided an overview of the current Jupyter workbooks and datasets 
available via [Tim Sherrattâ€™s](https://twitter.com/wragge) [GLAM Workbench](). We were also able to work on our 
own projects which involved writing python code in a Juptyer notebook to work 
with data and create digital outputs of data analysis. Day two was
rather overwhelming due to the sheer volume of information provided but, by the 
third day, everything clicked and I was able to compelete two projects. 

### Project One: World War I Music Scores
The notebook queries the *World War I Music Scores* dataset provided by the 
State Library of Queensland and performs some very simple data manipulation 
and analysis.

### Project Two: ATSI Language Materials
This notebook explores the the State Library of Queensland *Collection items in
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages* dataset.
