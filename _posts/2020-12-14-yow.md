Notes from a two day developer conference held 8-9 December 2020.
<!--more-->
The conference was broadcast via YouTube Live chat, with comments turned off, and Slack was used to host the online community. This was done really well and ensured that Yow! remained interactive rather than being just a bunch of webinars strung together. There were separate slack channels with each of the speakers for Q&A sessions, virtual sponsor booths, a tech-support channel and an all-important banter channel.

What surprised me was that Yow! was much more academically geared than I had expected. I had thought it would have a practical focus and was pleasantly surprised at the high calibre of research being discussed. I have a very loooong list of new concepts and reading material to work through but, mostly, I want to research more about microservices and testing APIs. Also keen on joining a local code reading club, if such a thing exists.

Some recurring themes and concepts I noticed were:
- [Metcalf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law)
- [Conways' law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)
- [Dunbar's Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number)
- [Continuous delivery](https://continuousdelivery.com/)
- [Microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices)
- [ACID: _Atomic Consistent Isolated Durability_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)
