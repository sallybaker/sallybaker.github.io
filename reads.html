  <p><strong>08 Jan 2022</strong> <a href="https://www.griffithreview.com/articles/might-rainbows/" target="_blank">Might be rainbows</a> - Holly Ringland, <em>Griffith Review</em><br>
    A personal anecdote about an Aboriginal art collecting road-trip through the desert. It's a tale of camaraderie between friends, and strangers, connecting in one of the most remote places on earth. The imagery of the Australian outback is vivid and even though the story leans into many of the stereotypes of Australian bush literature, it brings fresh and surprising elements to the genre.
