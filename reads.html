  <p><strong>08 Jan 2022</strong> <a href="https://www.griffithreview.com/articles/might-rainbows/" target="_blank">Might be rainbows</a> - Holly Ringland, <em>Griffith Review</em><br>
    A personal anecdote about an Aboriginal art collecting road-trip through the desert. It's a tale of camaraderie between friends, and strangers, connecting in one of the most remote places on earth. The imagery of the Australian outback is vivid and even though the story leans into many of the stereotypes of Australian bush literature, it brings fresh and surprising elements to the genre.

   <p><strong>26 June 2022</strong> Flowers for Algernon - Daniel Keyes, <em>The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction</em><br>
     A short story told via a series of diary entries during a scientific experiment. The main protagonist undergoes a surgical procedure to increase his intelligence. The story focuses on how the results of that experiment affect his perception of the world and his interpersonal relationships. It invites readers to question the nature of friendship and power dynamics between people of different intelligences, and the ethics of trying to 'improve' people.
